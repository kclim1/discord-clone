# Chord 

Welcome to **Chord**, a personal project aimed at exploring and understanding the underlying technologies that power real-time chat applications like Discord. This project serves as both a learning tool and a platform to experiment with modern web development and real-time communication features.For now, Chord only supports 1:1 realtime chat

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind building this clone is to gain a deeper understanding of:
- Real-time communication using **Socket.IO**.
- Backend and frontend integration in full-stack applications.
- Technologies that enable features like chat rooms, direct messaging, and user presence.
- Building scalable and maintainable architectures for modern web apps.
